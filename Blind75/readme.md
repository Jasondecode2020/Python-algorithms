### Blind75 

This is one of the famous LEETCODE problem set made by shunyang, a facebook staff software engineer, and it is still very popular in today's famous IT company's interviews. As python is suitable for most of the company as an interview language, I edited my coding into Jupyter notebook, this is easier for you to try bits and pieces in your local environment to grasp the gist of each question.

On later stage, I'll try to solve the neetcode150 question set, basically it is an enrichment of Blind75, developed by google software engineer.
