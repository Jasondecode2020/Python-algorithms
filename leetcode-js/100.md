### 1 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

Easy: 34s, bit manipulation

Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
Example 2:

Input: head = [0]
Output: 0

Constraints:

The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.

```js
var getDecimalValue = function (head) {
  let res = 0;
  while (head) {
    res = res * 2 + head.val;
    head = head.next;
  }
  return res;
};
```

bit manipulation is the easiest way to solve it.
if there is a new bit at the rightmost side, shift the old bits and plus the new bit

### 2 1720. Decode XORed Array

Easy: 43s, bit manipulation

There is a hidden integer array arr that consists of n non-negative integers.

It was encoded into another integer array encoded of length n - 1, such that encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]. For example, if arr = [1,0,2,1], then encoded = [1,2,3].

You are given the encoded array. You are also given an integer first, that is the first element of arr, i.e. arr[0].

Return the original array arr. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

Example 1:

Input: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]
Example 2:

Input: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4
Output: [4,2,0,7,4]

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 104
encoded.length == n - 1
0 <= encoded[i] <= 105
0 <= first <= 105

```js
var decode = function (encoded, first) {
  let res = [first];
  for (let item of encoded) {
    res.push(res.slice(res.length - 1) ^ item);
  }
  return res;
};
```

If a xor b = c then show that a xor c = b and b xor c = a using boolean algebra

This is a problem of bit operation of xor

Step-by-step explanation:

```
a xor b = c

take xor with 'a' both side

a xor(a xor b) = a xor c

Now, we know a xor a = 0,

0 xor b = a xor c

or, we can say: -

b = a xor c
```

### 3 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

Easy: 46s, bit manipulation

Given an integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero.

In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

Example 1:

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
Explanation:
Step 1) 14 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 2) 7 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 6.
Step 3) 6 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 3.
Step 4) 3 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 2.
Step 5) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 6) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 2:

Input: num = 8
Output: 4
Explanation:
Step 1) 8 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 4.
Step 2) 4 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 2.
Step 3) 2 is even; divide by 2 and obtain 1.
Step 4) 1 is odd; subtract 1 and obtain 0.
Example 3:

Input: num = 123
Output: 12

Constraints:

0 <= num <= 106

```js
var numberOfSteps = function (num) {
  let res = 0;
  while (num) {
    num = num % 2 === 0 ? num / 2 : num - 1;
    res++;
  }
  return res;
};
```

Given an integer n and an integer start.

Define an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2\*i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length.

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.
Where "^" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, start = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.
Example 3:

  }
  return res;
};
```

### 5 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

Easy: 65s, bit manipulation

You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

Example 1:

Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
Example 2:

Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.
Example 3:

Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 104
1 <= allowed.length <= 26
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
The characters in allowed are distinct.
words[i] and allowed contain only lowercase English letters.

```js
var countConsistentStrings = function (allowed, words) {
  let res = words.length;
  for (let item of words) {
    for (let c of item) {
      if (!allowed.includes(c)) {
        res--;
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  return res;
};
```

### 6 1863. Sum of All Subset XOR Totals

Easy, bit manipulation

The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, or 0 if the array is empty.

For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.
Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.

Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.

An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:

- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [3] has an XOR total of 3.
- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.
  0 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 6
  Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,1,6]
Output: 28
Explanation: The 8 subsets of [5,1,6] are:

- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [5] has an XOR total of 5.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [6] has an XOR total of 6.
- [5,1] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 = 4.
- [5,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 6 = 3.
- [1,6] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 6 = 7.
- [5,1,6] has an XOR total of 5 XOR 1 XOR 6 = 2.
  0 + 5 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 28
  Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 480
Explanation: The sum of all XOR totals for every subset is 480.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 12
1 <= nums[i] <= 20

```js
var subsetXORSum = function (nums) {
  const helper = (idx, res) => {
    if (idx === nums.length) return res;
    const withBit = helper(idx + 1, res ^ nums[idx]);
    const withoutBit = helper(idx + 1, res);
    return withBit + withoutBit;
  };
  return helper(0, 0);
};
```

This method is tree backtracking

better method:

  let n = nums.length,
    res = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    res |= nums[i];
  }
  return (res * 1) << (n - 1);
};
```

math is difficult

### 7 461. Hamming Distance

Easy, bit manipulation

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:

Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1 (0 0 0 1)
4 (0 1 0 0)
↑ ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
Example 2:

Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1

Constraints:

0 <= x, y <= 231 - 1

```js
var hammingDistance = function (x, y) {
  let x_bit = x.toString(2);
  let y_bit = y.toString(2);
  let res = 0;
  if (x_bit.length > y_bit.length) {
    y_bit = y_bit.padStart(x_bit.length, 0);
  } else {
    x_bit = x_bit.padStart(y_bit.length, 0);
  }
  for (let i = 0; i < x_bit.length; i++) {
    if (x_bit[i] !== y_bit[i]) {
      res++;
    }
  }
  return res;
};
```

normal method: O(n)
note: toString(2), y_bit = y_bit.padStart(x_bit.length, 0);

Easy, bit manipulation

Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
Example 2:

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101

Constraints:

0 <= n <= 105

Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like \_\_builtin_popcount in C++)?

```js
var sortByBits = function (arr) {
  // sort original arr first to keep in case of
  // two or more integers have the same number of 1's
  // you have to sort them in ascending order.
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  // prepare dp in leetcode 338
  let n = 10000;
  let res = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  for (let i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)];
    } else {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)] + 1;
    }
  }
  // sort arr according to count of '1s'
  arr.sort((a, b) => res[a] - res[b]);
  return arr;
};
```

Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
idx = 1, arr[1] = arr[0] + 1 = 1
idx = 2, arr[2] = arr[1] = 1
idx = 3, arr[3] = arr[1] + 1 = 2
idx = 4, arr[4] = arr[2] = 1
idx = 5, arr[5] = arr[2] + 1 = 2
Jsut use Dp is a good way to solve it.

### 9 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits

Easy, bit manipulation

You are given an integer array arr. Sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the array after sorting it.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1024,512,256,128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]
Output: [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024]
Explantion: All integers have 1 bit in the binary representation, you should just sort them in ascending order.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 500
0 <= arr[i] <= 104

```js
var sortByBits = function (arr) {
  arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let n = 10000;
  let res = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  for (let i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)];
    } else {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)] + 1;
    }
  }
  arr.sort((a, b) => res[a] - res[b]);
  return arr;
};
```

### 10 136. Single Number

Easy, bit manipulation

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 _ 104
-3 _ 104 <= nums[i] <= 3 \* 104
Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

```js
var singleNumber = function (nums) {
  let set = new Set();
  for (let num of nums) {
    if (set.has(num)) {
      set.delete(num);
    } else {
      set.add(num);
    }
  }
  return [...set][0];
};
```

use a set is a good way to make time O(n)

### 11 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation

Easy, bit manipulation

Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1's present when written in binary.

For example, 21 written in binary is 10101, which has 3 set bits.

Example 1:

Input: left = 6, right = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6 -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7 -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
8 -> 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
9 -> 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.
Example 2:

Input: left = 10, right = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.

Constraints:

1 <= left <= right <= 106
0 <= right - left <= 104

```js
var countPrimeSetBits = function (left, right) {
  const isPrime = (x) => {
    if (x === 1) return false;
    if (x === 2) return true;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(x); i++) {
      if (x % i === 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  };

  let n = 1000000;
  let res = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  for (let i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)];
    } else {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)] + 1;
    }
  }

  let ans = 0;
  for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
    if (isPrime(res[i])) ans++;
  }
  return ans;
};
```

it takes time, not good

change n to right, better, but not good

```js
var countPrimeSetBits = function (left, right) {
  const isPrime = (x) => {
    if (x === 1) return false;
    if (x === 2) return true;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(x); i++) {
      if (x % i === 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  };

  let n = right;
  let res = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
  for (let i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)];
    } else {
      res[i] = res[parseInt(i / 2)] + 1;
    }
  }

  let ans = 0;
  for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
    if (isPrime(res[i])) ans++;
  }
  return ans;
};
```

a better way

```js
var countPrimeSetBits = function (left, right) {
  // check is num is prime
  const isPrime = (x) => {
    if (x === 1) return false;
    if (x === 2) return true;
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(x); i++) {
      if (x % i === 0) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  };
  //count 1
  const countOnes = (x) => {
    let counter = 0;
    for (let c of x) {
      if (c === "1") counter++;
    }
    return counter;
  };
  // get the ans
  let ans = 0;
  for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
    if (isPrime(countOnes(i.toString(2)))) ans++;
  }
  return ans;
};
```

### 12 1763. Longest Nice Substring

Easy, bit manipulation

A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, it appears both in uppercase and lowercase. For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' appear. However, "abA" is not because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.

Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. If there are multiple, return the substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "YazaAay"
Output: "aAa"
Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 'A' and 'a' appear.
"aAa" is the longest nice substring.
Example 2:

Input: s = "Bb"
Output: "Bb"
Explanation: "Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.
Example 3:

Input: s = "c"
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no nice substrings.
Example 4:

Input: s = "dDzeE"
Output: "dD"
Explanation: Both "dD" and "eE" are the longest nice substrings.
As there are multiple longest nice substrings, return "dD" since it occurs earlier.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

  for (let i = 1; i < str_n.length; i++) {
    if (str_n[i - 1] === str_n[i]) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
};
```

### 14 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

Easy, bit manipulation

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer n, return its complement.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
Example 3:

Input: n = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.

  let str_n = n.toString(2);
  return Math.pow(2, str_n.length) - n - 1;
};
```

Output: "a"

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lower-case English letters.

```js
var findTheDifference = function (s, t) {
  let d = {};
  for (let c of s) {
    d[c] = d[c] ? d[c] + 1 : 1;
  }
  for (let c of t) {
    if (d[c]) {
      d[c] = d[c] - 1;
    } else {
      return c;
    }
  }
};

### 16 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Easy

Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

var findRestaurant = function (list1, list2) {
  const d = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < list1.length; i++) {
    if (list2.indexOf(list1[i]) !== -1) {
      d.set(list1[i], i + list2.indexOf(list1[i]));

### 17 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence

Easy

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Given an integer array nums, return the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A subsequence of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 0

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 \* 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

```js
var findLHS = function (nums) {
  const record = new Map();
  for (const num of nums) {
    record.set(num, (record.get(num) ?? 0) + 1);
  }
  let max = 0;
  for (let low of record.keys()) {
    if (record.has(low + 1)) {
      max = Math.max(max, record.get(low) + record.get(low + 1));
    }
  }

  return max;
};
```

### 18 1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses

Easy, stack

A valid parentheses string is either empty "", "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.

For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.
A valid parentheses string s is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into s = A + B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string s, consider its primitive decomposition: s = P1 + P2 + ... + Pk, where Pi are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return s after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of s.

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation:
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
Example 2:

Input: s = "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"
Explanation:
The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: ""
Explanation:
The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '(' or ')'.
s is a valid parentheses string.

```js
var removeOuterParentheses = function (s) {
  let stack = [];
  let res = "";
  let pos = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (s[i] === "(") {
      stack.push(s[i]);
    } else {
      stack.pop();
    }
    if (stack.length === 0) {
      res += s.slice(pos + 1, i);
      pos = i + 1;
    }
  }
  return res;
};
```

### 19 897. Increasing Order Search Tree

Easy

Given the root of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only one right child.

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]
Example 2:

Input: root = [5,1,7]
Output: [1,null,5,null,7]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 1000

```js
var increasingBST = function (root) {
  let arr = [];
  const getTree = (root) => {
    if (!root) return;
    if (root.left) getTree(root.left);
    arr.push(root.val);
    if (root.right) getTree(root.right);
  };
  getTree(root);

  let tree = new TreeNode();
  let temp = tree;
  while (arr.length) {
    temp.right = new TreeNode(arr.shift());
    temp = temp.right;
  }
  return tree.right;
};
```

first inorder traversal, then get res, arr used as queue
space consuming

### 20 112. Path Sum

Easy

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
Example 3:

Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
Output: false
Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

```js
var hasPathSum = function (root, targetSum) {
  if (!root) return false;
  if (!root.left && !root.right) return root.val === targetSum;
  return (
    hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val) ||
    hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)
  );
};
```

### 21 113. Path Sum II

Medium

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
Explanation: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:
5 + 4 + 11 + 2 = 22
5 + 8 + 4 + 5 = 22
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000

```js
var pathSum = function (root, targetSum, sum = 0, arr = [], result = []) {
  if (!root) return result;
  sum += root.val;
  arr.push(root.val);
  if (sum === targetSum && !root.left && !root.right) result.push(arr);
  pathSum(root.left, targetSum, sum, [...arr], result);
  pathSum(root.right, targetSum, sum, [...arr], result);
  return result;
};
```

### 22 1. Two Sum

Easy 2min
hashmap

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

```js
var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const res = target - nums[i];
    if (map.has(res)) {
      return [map.get(res), i];
    }
    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
};
```

### 23 20. Valid Parentheses

Easy 4min

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

```js
var isValid = function (s) {
  const stack = [];
  for (let c of s) {
    if (
      (stack.slice(-1)[0] === "(" && c === ")") ||
      (stack.slice(-1)[0] === "[" && c === "]") ||
      (stack.slice(-1)[0] === "{" && c === "}")
    ) {
      stack.pop();
    } else {
      stack.push(c);
    }
  }
  if (stack.length === 0) return true;
  return false;
};
```

Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

```js
var mergeTwoLists = function (list1, list2) {
  const dummy = new ListNode();
  let head = dummy;
  while (list1 && list2) {
    if (list1.val < list2.val) {
      head.next = new ListNode(list1.val);
      head = head.next;
      list1 = list1.next;
    } else if (list1.val > list2.val) {
      head.next = new ListNode(list2.val);
      head = head.next;
      list2 = list2.next;
    } else {
      head.next = new ListNode(list1.val);
      head.next.next = new ListNode(list2.val);
      head = head.next.next;
      list1 = list1.next;
      list2 = list2.next;
    }
  }
  if (list1) head.next = list1;
  if (list2) head.next = list2;
  return dummy.next;
};
```

no need to write more node

```js
var mergeTwoLists = function (list1, list2) {
  const dummy = new ListNode();
  let head = dummy;
  while (list1 && list2) {
    if (list1.val < list2.val) {
      head.next = list1;
      list1 = list1.next;
    } else {
      head.next = list2;
      list2 = list2.next;
    }
    head = head.next;
  }
  head.next = list1 || list2;
  return dummy.next;
};
```

### 25 35. Search Insert Position

Easy 4min

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4

Constraints:

  let high = nums.length - 1;
  while (low <= high) {
    mid = parseInt((low + high) / 2);
    if (nums[mid] > target) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return low;
};
```

### 26 53. Maximum Subarray

Easy 5min, 3min

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104

Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

```js
var maxSubArray = function (nums) {
  const dp = new Array(nums.length).fill(0);
  dp[0] = nums[0];
  let res = dp[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {

### 31 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Easy

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

```js
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let res = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {

### 32 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

Easy

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

```js
var maxProfit = function (prices) {
  let maxProfit = 0;
  let lowest = prices[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    if (prices[i] - lowest > maxProfit) maxProfit = prices[i] - lowest;

  }
  return maxProfit;
};
```

### 33 136. Single Number

Easy

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

  const set = new Set();
  for (num of nums) {
    if (set.has(num)) {
      set.delete(num);
    } else {

    }
  }
  return [...set][0];
};
```

### 34 141. Linked List Cycle

Easy

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

```js
var hasCycle = function (head) {
  const set = new Set();
  while (head) {
    if (set.has(head)) return true;
    set.add(head);
    head = head.next;
  }
  return false;
};
```

```js
var hasCycle = function (head) {
  let fast = head;
  let slow = head;

  while (fast) {
    if (!fast.next) return false;
    //travels twice as fast as lagging pointer. if a cycle exists,
    //it will equal the lagging pointer at some point
    fast = fast.next.next;
    slow = slow.next;
    if (fast === slow) return true;
  }
  return false;
};
```

edge cases

```js
var hasCycle = function (head) {
  let fast = head;
  let slow = head;
  while (fast) {
    if (!fast.next) return false;
    fast = fast.next.next;
    slow = slow.next;
    if (slow === fast) return true;
  }
  return false;
};
```

### 35 169. Majority Element

Easy

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

```js
var majorityElement = function(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    let majority = null;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (count === 0) majority = num;
        num === majority ? count++ : count--;
    }
    return majority;
};
```

### 206. Reverse Linked List

Easy

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []
 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 
Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

```js
var reverseList = function(head) {
    const reverse = (prev, curr) => {
        if (!curr) return prev
        next = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        return reverse(prev, curr);
    }
    return reverse(null, head);
};
```
